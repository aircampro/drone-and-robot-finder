This repository is showing my results from testing a training a vision model to be used to identify robot, and drone and people. It has been labelled and trained on roboflow
The model is RF-DETR (Small) MS Coco format
v3 is the smaller first set - works quite nice 
v7 is later with more image it finds more types of drone esp. military but needs a lower threshold to see objects
